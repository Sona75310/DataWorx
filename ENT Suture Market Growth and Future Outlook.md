The rising prevalence of ENT disorders, coupled with the growing geriatric population, significantly contributes to the demand for ENT surgeries, thereby propelling the suture market. According to industry estimates, the global ENT suture market was valued at approximately <strong>$250 million</strong> in <span>2023</span>.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the market is projected to witness a steady compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around <strong>6.5%</strong> from <span>2024</span> to <span>2032</span>. This growth trajectory reflects the increasing number of ENT surgeries, including otologic, rhinologic, and laryngologic procedures, which necessitate the use of sutures. By <span>2025</span>, the market is anticipated to reach <strong>$270 million</strong>, further expanding to approximately <strong>$390 million</strong> by <span>2032</span>.</p> <p>Technological advancements in suture materials and techniques are also expected to play a pivotal role in market expansion. Development of biodegradable sutures and minimally invasive surgical techniques enhance patient outcomes and recovery times, leading to increased adoption of these products in clinical practice. Furthermore, the growing awareness and training of healthcare professionals regarding innovative surgical methods are anticipated to boost the demand for ENT sutures.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>In terms of product type, absorbable sutures are projected to dominate the market, attributed to their ease of use and the reduced need for removal post-surgery. By <span>2026</span>, absorbable sutures are expected to constitute roughly <strong>65%</strong> of the ENT suture market share. Non-absorbable sutures will also hold a significant share, particularly for long-term applications and high-tension cases.
